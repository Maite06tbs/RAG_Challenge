# **Roadmap to Building Your Own RAG-Based System**

## **Introduction**
🎉 Welcome to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workshop! The goal of this challenge is to help you design and implement your own RAG-based system. This roadmap will guide you through brainstorming ideas, understanding the challenge, and leveraging the provided resources to create a unique project.

---

## **Step 1: Understand the RAG Framework**
📚 Before diving into the challenge, ensure you understand the key components of a RAG system:

1. **Retrieval**: Extract relevant information from a knowledge base (e.g., documents, PDFs).
2. **Augmentation**: Use the retrieved information to provide context for the generation process.
3. **Generation**: Generate responses or outputs using a language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT).

---

## **Step 2: Brainstorm Ideas**
💡 Think about real-world problems or scenarios where a RAG-based system could be useful. Here are some examples to inspire you:

### **Education**
- 📖 Build a system that answers questions based on lecture notes or textbooks.
- 📝 Create a study assistant that summarizes key concepts from academic papers.

### **Business**
- 📊 Develop a tool to extract insights from company reports or financial documents.
- 🤖 Create a chatbot that answers FAQs based on internal documentation.

### **Healthcare**
- 🩺 Design a system to provide medical information from research papers or guidelines.
- 🏥 Build a tool to assist doctors by summarizing patient case studies.

### **Personal Productivity**
- 🗂️ Create a personal assistant that organizes and retrieves information from your notes.
- 📚 Build a system to summarize and analyze books or articles.

## **Step 3: Define Your Challenge**
🛠️ Once you have an idea, define the scope of your project:

1. **Objective**: What problem are you solving?
2. **Data Source**: What documents or knowledge base will you use?
3. **User Interaction**: How will users interact with your system (e.g., chatbot, web app)?

---

## **Step 4: Leverage the Provided Resources**
📂 Use the provided notebook and `.py` files as references to implement your project:

1. **Notebook**: The notebook demonstrates the step-by-step implementation of a RAG system. Use it to understand the workflow and adapt it to your project.
2. **Python Files**: The `.py` files contain reusable functions and pipelines. Use them to streamline your development process.

---

## **Step 5: Build Your System**
🛠️ Follow these steps to build your RAG-based system:

1. **Set Up the Environment**: Install the required libraries and authenticate APIs.
2. **Ingest Data**: Load and preprocess your documents.
3. **Create a Vector Store**: Generate embeddings and store them for retrieval.
4. **Configure the LLM**: Set up the language model for response generation.
5. **Integrate Components**: Combine retrieval and generation into a cohesive system.
6. **Test and Iterate**: Test your system with sample queries and refine it based on feedback.

---

## **Step 6: Present Your Project**
🎤 Prepare a short presentation to showcase your project:

1. **Problem Statement**: What problem does your system solve?
2. **Solution**: How does your RAG-based system address the problem?
3. **Demo**: Show a live demo or screenshots of your system in action.
4. **Challenges and Learnings**: Share any challenges you faced and what you learned.

## 🎉 **BONUS SECTION: ENHANCE YOUR RAG SYSTEM!** 🎉

Take your RAG-based system to the next level by exploring these advanced features:

### 1️⃣ **Prompt Templates for Augmentation**
- Use a prompt template to structure the input for your LLM.
- This ensures consistency and improves the quality of generated responses.

#### Example:
```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = "You are an expert assistant. Based on the following context, answer the question accurately and concisely:\n\nContext: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:"
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=['context', 'question'])

# Use the prompt in your RAG chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(), chain_type_kwargs={'prompt': prompt})
```

### 2️⃣ **Experiment with Retrieval Algorithms**
- Try different retrieval strategies like Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) or SelfQueryRetriever.
- Adjust parameters like "k" (number of documents retrieved) to optimize performance.

### 3️⃣ **Switch Vector Databases**
- Explore alternatives to FAISS, such as Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus.
- Choose a database that aligns with your scalability and performance needs.

### 4️⃣ **Multi-Document Chunking with Metadata**
- Use metadata to tag chunks with additional information (e.g., source, section, date).
- This improves retrieval accuracy and allows for more granular filtering.

#### Example:
```python
chunks_with_metadata = [{'text': chunk, 'metadata': {'source': 'Document A', 'section': 'Introduction'}} for chunk in chunks]
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks_with_metadata, embeddings)
```

### 🚀 **Challenge Yourself!**
- Combine multiple advanced features to create a truly unique and powerful RAG system.
- Share your results and learnings with the group!
